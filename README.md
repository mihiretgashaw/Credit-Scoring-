Task 1 - Understanding Credit Risk

1. Basel II and the Importance of Interpretability
   The Basel II Capital Accord emphasizes accurate risk measurement to ensure that financial institutions hold adequate capital against their credit exposures. This regulatory focus heightens the need for credit scoring models that are interpretable, auditable, and well-documented. Models used in this context must not only predict default risk accurately but also provide transparency for internal risk management, auditors, and regulators. Simple models like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) are often preferred because they allow clear communication of risk factors and facilitate compliance with Basel’s Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach requirements.

2. Proxy Variables for Default Risk
   In the absence of an explicit "default" label in the dataset, creating a proxy variable (e.g., based on delinquency status, missed payments, or threshold events) becomes necessary to train a supervised learning model. However, this introduces several business risks:
   • Misalignment with actual defaults: The proxy may not fully capture real-world default behavior.
   • Biased model training: Patterns learned might reflect proxy-specific noise rather than true risk.
   • Regulatory scrutiny: Decisions made on inaccurate proxies can expose the institution to compliance risks. Therefore, it is critical to define and validate proxies carefully using both domain expertise and empirical evidence.
3. Trade-offs: Interpretability vs. Performance
   • In regulated financial environments, there's a trade-off between using simple, interpretable models and complex models that might offer higher performance. The table provided summarizes this:
   o Interpretability: Simple models (e.g., Logistic Regression + WoE) are highly interpretable and easy to explain to regulators, while complex models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) are often considered "black boxes".
   o Regulatory Acceptance: Simple models have a strong track record of regulatory acceptance, whereas complex models may face challenges during audits.
   o Performance (AUC, Gini): Complex models generally offer higher performance metrics like AUC and Gini, while simple models have moderate performance.
   o Implementation Cost: Simple models have lower implementation costs due to fewer infrastructure needs, while complex models require higher costs for monitoring and tuning.
   o Risk Transparency: Simple models provide clear variable influence, making it easy to attribute risk contributions, unlike complex models where this is difficult.
   • This clearly illustrates that while complex models might offer superior predictive power, their lack of transparency and higher implementation costs, coupled with potential regulatory hurdles, make simple models often more practical and preferred in credit scoring for regulated industries. A hybrid approach, where complex models are used for internal insights and simpler ones for decision-making and reporting, can be a way to balance these trade-offs.
